    <h1>Quirrelites</h1>
    <p>
        An incredibly diverse race of bug people. They can take on many forms, 
        resembling bugs with bug or hummin forms, or completely unique forms, 
        sizing from hummin size to barely visible. Because of the vastness and 
        diversity of this race, all sorts of personalities can be found among 
        them. As a collective, though, they are a bit more primitive than the 
        rest of the world. Still, they have a language, cities, tools, and 
        societies, and plenty of mechanical systems, and they are beginning to 
        use electricity.
