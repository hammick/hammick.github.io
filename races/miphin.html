    <h1>Miphin</h1>
    <p>
        A race of fish-like humminids who live in the oceans and seas. Their scaled skin can 
        be many vibrant colors, solid or multicolored, their bellies white. Miphin live in 
        large colonies and can breathe in air and water. They are very sensual, artistic, and 
        passionate people, yet they tend to live solitarily or in small groups, and most don't 
        care for others of their kind or other races, ranging from welcoming to apathetic to 
        unwelcoming to outsiders. Still, they are in-tune with their emotions and are innately 
        curious, and always eager to contribute to society (theirs or others) nonetheless.

        The Miphin have bodies adapted to underwater vocalizing. Their voices are high-pitched 
        and project; nonetheless, they have mouths that can articulate the specific words of their
        language, and with practice they can pronounce words in Common.
