    <h1>Fhasan (FAH-zahn)</h1>
    <p>
        A race of living plant people, and members of the larger Fhasa 
        collective (living plants). Similar to the quirrelites, they are 
        'incredibly widespread and diverse. Even more so than the 
        quirrelites, they vary greatly in anatomy and have many distinct 
        cultures. Some take humminid form, and some even leave their verdant 
        homes to live among the humminid races.
