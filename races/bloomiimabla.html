    <h1>Bloomiimabla (BLOO-mee-mah-bla)</h1>
    <p>
        An exotic race of fungal people. Found deep in the depths of 
        mushroom forests (or sometimes normal forests), these people are 
        usually seen only by lost adventurers. They are relatively 
        primitive, living in villages with improvised structures, wielding 
        melee weapons, and speaking a language distinct from all others. 
        They take many unique forms, some humminid, some not. Though 
        primitive, they are said to be a very old and wise race, and 
        connected strongly to nature and the world.
