    <h1>Earthin</h1>
    <p>
        Though each one has a different tale as to their race's origin, Earthins are 
        definitely an old race. Living in a vast underground world, these thick-skinned, 
        round and chubby humminids have light skin and dark fur, and claws on their four 
        limbs for digging. They also are long adapted to eating underground critters and 
        minerals with their snout-like incisored mouths. Social creatures, cut off from 
        the craziness of the outside world, they are compassionate and cooperative, though 
        they are very unfamiliar with culture that is not their own, and seem very strange 
        to outsiders. They also are less sophisticated and advanced, and definitely not as 
        bright as other races, but they are incredibly hard and reliable workers, and 
        excellent at digging, forging, and building. They can walk on two or four legs with 
        ease, and have an excellent sense of direction. They seldom leave their underground 
        homes, and one living on the surface is quite rare.
