    <h1>Cephaloid</h1>
    <p>
        Cephaloids are an enigmatic race of sapient octopuses that live deep in the ocean. Rarely seen by any others, they tend to keep to themselves. They are highly intelligent and logical, very good at solving problems. Their default coloration is red and white striped, although they can change the color and texture of their skin to blend into their environment like any other octopus. They cannot speak verbally, instead changing the color of their skin in unique patterns to communicate with each other. This makes communication with other races challenging.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unlike what one would expect from octopuses, they are highly social and get along with each other quite well. Regardless, they are quite free spirited and can go their own way without much trouble. They often specialize in ambush tactics when hunting and fighting, just like their primitive ancestors.
    </p>
    <p>
        They are usually the size of a large dog, although great variation exists and some have been seen to grow much larger. Being made out of pure muscle, they have phenomenal strength and can defeat most unarmed opponents with ease. Theyâ€™ve been known to kill large sharks barehanded. Non-aquatic races that try to fight Cephaloids on their home turf rarely succeed. However, given their emphasis on ambush tactics, and relatively slow speed compared to other aquatic races such as the Miphin, they are typically much better at defense than offense and rarely pursue conquest.
