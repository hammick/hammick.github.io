    <h1>Faerie</h1>
    <p>
        Faeries are a humminoid subtype of Fey who are typically small and mischievous. They exhibit sexual dimorphism, with females being known as pixies and males being known as leprechauns. 
    </p>

        Faeries are roughly two feet tall on average. They are always tied to some aspect of nature, and are naturally gifted in the use of magic related to it. What natural aspects they can embody varies greatly, ranging from basic elements to animals or plants to even more abstract concepts such as insanity. Nobody has ever witnessed a faerie being born or reproducing; our best guess is that they spontaneously generate. The aspect of nature they are tied to is typically one with a strong presence in the area they first appeared. Hair color can vary greatly, appearing in shades not often found in mortals; their hair color is often related to the aspect of nature they represent.

    <p>
        Faeries like to play pranks on mortals, and while rarely outright malicious, their understanding of what constitutes a “prank” is sometimes different than that of mortals. This is because faeries do not die in the same manner that mortals do; when their physical forms are destroyed, they will simply return to the magic aether for a time before reincarnating later, often in the same place they originated from. Because of this, their concept of death is highly warped and they may not realize or care about the implications it has for other races. It has been rumored that the only way to truly destroy a faerie for good is to find their point of origin and purge whatever aspect of nature they represent from the general vicinity. However, this is naturally quite hard to test so it is disputed.

    <p>
        When a faerie is physically destroyed, its body will collapse into faerie dust. This extremely useful material contains magical properties similar to the faeries themselves, and is often coveted by mortal races, so they are often hunted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Faeries can be found in all worlds, and typically represent whatever is “natural” in their world of origin.
