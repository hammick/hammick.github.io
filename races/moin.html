    <h1>Moin (MO-in)</h1>
    <p>
        In odd depths of jungles, damp cave entrances, and sandy mesa 
        canyons, live the Moin. These people are alien to the larger 
        societies of the world, and seldom seen by them. Most of the Moin 
        live together in colonies, of which there are perhaps a few across 
        the continent.

    <p>
        Moins speak their own simple language. Their colonies are actually 
        impressive and complex, having systems of rulership and government, 
        worship, games and performances, and social classes within a single 
        colony.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now and then an outsider may stumble across a Moin society, and be 
        met with varying reactions depending on circumstance. Generally, 
        though, many Moins are suspicious of outsiders, though some who are 
        more accustomed to the presence of other races are more welcoming. 
        Even more rarely, though, one of their members will leave their 
        colony. This is usually temporary, but  it has happened that a Moin 
        has left their colony to be part of another society. Moins are fully 
        capable of learning and speaking Common, though they prefer to keep 
        their sentences and grammar simple, like their native language. From 
        the perspective of a “civilized” person, Moins are odd in behavior, 
        manners, and thought, and are often on completely different 
        wavelengths than other people. As a result, though, Moins tend to 
        think in more creative, abstract ways, and offer completely 
        unexpected ideas, regardless of how good they might be.

        Moins resemble hummins, generally having broader heads and bodies, 
        skin color varying from sand to bronze or dark brown, depending on 
        where they live. Body weight varies extensively among Moins, 
        primarily based on one’s social status, and therefore, how much they 
        eat.
