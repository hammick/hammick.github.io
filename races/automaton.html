    <h1>Automatons</h1>
    <p>
        Electricians and mechanics can create robots; infusing these with certain magics 
        can create a living, feeling being out of these robots. Through their soul, 
        they can feel emotions, thought, and awareness, but physical feelings, like pain 
        or fatigue, or physical abilities depend on how they are built. Still, these living 
        robots can be found now and then in the world, sometimes living among other 
        populations. Because of their specific physical properties or uses, they are sought 
        for their excellence at certain types of work. The feelings of robots are not entirely 
        understood but seem to be identical to real living races, and they can be raised, 
        affected, and conditioned all the same.
