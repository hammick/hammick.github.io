    <h1>Spriteling</h1>
    <p>
        One of the stranger races on the planet, Spritelings superficially 
        resemble hummins but are typically much shorter and more childlike. 
        They are extremely energetic and, despite their small stature, they 
        are capable of incredible acrobatic feats; being able to jump 
        several times their own body height is considered normal from their 
        perspective. Their primary limiting factor is that they are 
        generally quite frail. They have to make up for their weakness with 
        agility in combat. Their disposition tends towards friendly and 
        outgoing. Strangely, this personality tends to persist regardless of 
        how they actually behave; even the most sadistic of them will seem 
        to act with a childlike glee. It is almost impossible to predict the
         actions or intentions of an unknown Spriteling because of this. 
         They tend to be highly adventurous, often venturing out into the 
         world on a whim, so one can expect to find individuals almost 
         anywhere in the world.

        At the center of their civilization is a small order of elite warriors called the Temporals. These individuals specialize in using time magic to their advantage, and often carry enchantments that will rewind them if they die. Other beings rarely perceive this magic being used, and instead will see the warrior as being seemingly supernaturally lucky and skilled. Because of this, itâ€™s hard to tell just how many Temporals there really are. While verified Temporals are extremely rare, they often become legendary due to their achievements seeming miraculous from outside perspectives.
