    <h1>Buphalin</h1>
    <p>
        Outside the confines of cities, in the middle of nature, the Buphalin can be found. 
        Having homes in modest tribes throughout the continent, different groups of Buphalin 
        populate the world's plains, deserts, swamps, caves, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Buphalin have a strong resemblance to hummins, having more defined bodies and faces. 
        Their height is similar to hummins but with much less deviation, and they are thinner 
        on average than hummins. They also tend to have slightly darker skin than hummins of 
        the same region, as they are outside much more often.
        Buphalin have strong spiritual ties with nature and the universe, on a philosophical 
        and magical level. Because of these bonds, most of them reject the technology of 
        advanced races, living among the wilderness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Though not remotely well versed in "civilized" life or thought, Buphalin are very wise and perceptive people, at least in their scope of life, and they often spend their free time meditating. Most commonly, the wisest person of each tribe is elected as the efaj, or chieftain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Communities of Buphalin vary greatly. Some are peaceful, while a few are more aggressive, violent, or untrusting. Different regions or tribes speak different dialects, though they all have a common root language, Buphalba.
